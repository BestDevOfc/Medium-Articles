We begin by explaining all of the security features of a real US bill, and then how it’s replicated by counterfeiters. Technical methods are used in counterfeiting, from specialized paper to evading DRM systems. However, it’s important to remember the legal repurcussions from attempting any of this and how this merely serves as a method of raising awareness and protecting YOU from falling victim to counterfeit bills. Let’s dive right in!Read Part 1 here: <a href="https://medium.com/thedeephub/how-to-make-counterfeit-us-bills-f411f60495f6" data-href="https://medium.com/thedeephub/how-to-make-counterfeit-us-bills-f411f60495f6" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">Click Me</a></p><h3 name="9d38" id="9d38" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Chapter 3: Watermarks</h3><p name="cdc6" id="cdc6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">You heard that right, the US bill has loads of security protections hidden throughout the bill. Once the bill is printed you now have to fake these as well, we’ll start off with the watermark. Bills starting from the $5 and above will have a watermark of the US president on the bill. These watermarks are invisible until they’re held up to the light where they become apparent. Countefeiting these is simple, just print a watermark that’s transparent enough so that it’s only visible when held up to the light. Creating a watermark manually or through chemicals is more advanced and typically not the route small crooks will undertake.</p><figure name="1c93" id="1c93" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*kHlSXg-SzTin3MXV.jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="667" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*kHlSXg-SzTin3MXV.jpg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Genuine watermarks are made up of accurate lines and curves.</figcaption></figure><h3 name="ec99" id="ec99" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Chapter 4: Microprinting</h3><p name="017d" id="017d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">If you look very closely at the US bill you’ll notice there is extreme accuracy in the lines and text. If you look at a counterfeit bill it’s often blurred in certain spots or Pixely. This is because the US bills have microprinted text that surpasses any commercially available printer in the world right now. Moreover, the bills are printed in special electromagnetic ink. Therefore it’s not really possible to counterfeit these as a small time crook. Many people won’t notice, and to the naked eye if there’s no obvious blurs or faded lines it’ll pass off as genuine. As said before, the HP inkjet printers can capture the color and design of a genuine bill to an impressive extent, this is why it’s used amongst crooks all over the US.</p><figure name="bd85" id="bd85" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*SSXENqjx68gubl_AugBU3A.png" data-width="2152" data-height="754" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*SSXENqjx68gubl_AugBU3A.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">On the back of the real $100 bill this lamp post is slightly faded, but not on North Korea’s counterfeit $100 super bill.</figcaption></figure><p name="0de9" id="0de9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">However, that’s not to say it’s not possible, North Korea created their own counterfeit $100 superbill that had so much accuracy that it was better than the US’s own $100 bill! These superbills were so accurate that they printed certain parts of the $100 bill more accurately than the US’s own printing mills could. This is one of the reasons we now have that purple security ribbon on our $100 bills-these North Korea were unable to fake.</p><h3 name="b883" id="b883" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Chapter 5: Waterproofing</h3><p name="7eca" id="7eca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Another test that can be used on a genuine bill is to submerge it into a bowl of water for a few minutes and see if it survives-this is due to the unique ink and paper used by the US paper mills. In order to slightly waterproof a counterfeit bill many crooks will a thin layer of lacquer using a thin, sharp metal plate to quickly spread it evenly. This will pass the water test for a minute or two, and then after will fail-just enough time.</p><h3 name="2fa7" id="2fa7" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Chapter 6: Texture</h3><figure name="d99e" id="d99e" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*zpPssTcV_9Gh3Lv4" data-width="800" data-height="389" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*zpPssTcV_9Gh3Lv4"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Rub your fingers on that area-it’ll be raised and feel different than the rest of the bill!</figcaption></figure><p name="a28c" id="a28c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Go grab a dollar bill right now, doesn’t matter if it’s $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100, grab it, close your eyes, and slide your finger across the bill-notice anything? Yup, there are certain parts of the bill that have this weird raised texture feeling. This is done by subjecting the paper to thousands of pounds of pressure that causes the ink to slightly raise. Usually the textured features will be found on the US president’s clothing and other locations where darker ink was used. However, this is extremely easy to counterfeit with small time crooks. All it takes is a toothbrush, some liquid elmer’s glue, and some baking soda mixture to get the job done. By mixing these together and applying them to the locations of the bills needed it gives it a similar feel that you’d feel on a genuine bill. Of course it’s not the same, but anyone checking won’t realize and will just realize that it’s textured.</p><h3 name="acf5" id="acf5" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Chapter 7: Iodine Pen Bypass</h3><figure name="079a" id="079a" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*oPAuCWjm0zfofpK8.jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*oPAuCWjm0zfofpK8.jpg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">If the yellow turns darker = counterfeit</figcaption></figure><p name="2219" id="2219" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">In many bars throughout the US it’s common to pay in cash, but it’s also common to be handed a counterfeit bill. In order to quickly combat this many bars will use these Yellow Iodine markers that turn brown if the bill is fake and remain unchanged if the bill is genuine. After some research I realized the iodine will react with starch molecules leading to a color change. Starch is what makes up your typical white printer paper you find in stores. This won’t be an issue if you’re using the right paper mixture, so bypassing this not only bypasses the marker test but also ensures the right “feel” of the paper.</p><h3 name="4885" id="4885" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Chapter 8: Color-shifting ink &amp; Security strips</h3><p name="d7cd" id="d7cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">On some $20 and $100 bills I’m sure you’ve noticed the number has a bright golden color that’s textured with lines and when you move it left to right the color changes from gold to green. After some research it turns out it’s quite easy to buy these kinds of sticker strips in bulk from eBay or Aliexpress for a few bucks, and cut out the right shapes yourself using an X-acto blade.</p><figure name="45ba" id="45ba" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*oTWOmKH_OfjYJtTT.jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="1200" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*oTWOmKH_OfjYJtTT.jpg"></figure><h4 name="a425" id="a425" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">Faking the Security Strip</h4><p name="4a15" id="4a15" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The security strip is found in denomination higher than the $1 bill, this includes $5,$10, $20,$50, and $100 bills. The security strips light up under UV light and are now being used more commonly in malls and small chains around the US. Not only this, but the colors are also different for each denomination. The $5 bills have a blue color and the $10 bills have a orange color. Not only this, but there’s also a small microprinted text that states what denomination the bill is. Not only this, but you don’t always need to use a UV light, you could just hold the bill to the light and read the text on the security bill-if it’s not present, then it’s most likely fake.</p><figure name="5549" id="5549" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*zXVzW33hCuswEoa2omcDlw.png" data-width="1606" data-height="928" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*zXVzW33hCuswEoa2omcDlw.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Here a security strip is being extracted out of a genuine $20 bill.</figcaption></figure><p name="9a85" id="9a85" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">To counterfeit this many crooks will buy ink that glows under UV light similar to those invisible ink pens we used to play around with in elementary school. They work the same way, the light that uncovers the hidden text is just a cheap UV light. After buying the right color they’ll cut out the right size and dimenions from a thin layer of plastic or printing paper and then color over it generously. They’ll do the same on the backside of the bill. That way when a UV light is used it appears to be a security strip. This will only fool someone if they’re not reading the microprint or looking just for a color and not analyzing it too deeply. Of course it is possible to print out your own security strips with the small text, using paper, coloring them in the special ink, and placing them in between the bills before gluing them together using elmer’s glue, but many small scale operations won’t go through the hassle-and that’s what makes it so effective! Sometimes crooks will extract these security strips from genuine bills using tweezers and slightly ripping a small tear to extract it-but it’s not very common.</p><h3 name="b78b" id="b78b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Chapter 9: Converting Counterfeit to Genuine Bills</h3><p name="90de" id="90de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">If you use counterfeit bills wherever you go it’s only a matter of time before you’re tracked down and imprisoned. In order to evade detection a lot of crooks will either sell off the fake bills online usually on Telegram or on Tor marketplaces, but this requires marketing, building a customer base, and having the right connections with marketplace admins. An easier route people take is to go to restaurants and stores and purchase cheap items using high denomination bills in order to get change which is real money! A couple did this in 2016 making around $30,000 a week until they were later caught.</p><h3 name="841a" id="841a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Chapter 10: Avoid Getting Flagged by the FBI and Secret Service</h3><figure name="f9cc" id="f9cc" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*Kc_ULDdGf-Teq6Wl.gif" data-width="640" data-height="360" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Kc_ULDdGf-Teq6Wl.gif"><figcaption class="imageCaption">FBI please hire me.</figcaption></figure><p name="4ad6" id="4ad6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Many times these crooks are caught because of suspicious purchases (reported via Bank), search history (reported via ISP), or bragging about their riches on social media which initially gets the IRS interested and then leads to the FBI and Secret Service getting involved in finding out your counterfeit activities landing you a nice 20 year prison sentence and thousands in fines. In order to get around this a lot of people will open up shell companies or businesses to mask their illicit purchases. As a company that sells coloring books or gift wrappings it’s not suspicious for your company card to have purchases linked to bulk paper, stickers, ink, and printers. The more common thing small time crooks will undertake is using stolen identities to open VDCs (Virtual Debit Cards), or use an exchanger to convert their cryptocurrency (usually BTC, LTC, or XMR) into their Cashapp accounts or other virtual debit card services (easier route taken). This works because Cashapp offers an easy-to-use virtual card.</p><figure name="a593" id="a593" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*s7U_tIi7gMmbG6IK.png" data-width="600" data-height="400" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*s7U_tIi7gMmbG6IK.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Has a card number, billing address, CVV, be linked to Apple pay-everything a physical debit card can do.</figcaption></figure><p name="c1dd" id="c1dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">However, due to rising fraud Cashapp has hardened their verification and people are now using virtual banks such as Chime, verifying with someone else’s identity, ordering the debit card to a random address, and then using the virtual card provided as they don’t plan on using the physical card anyway. I’ve explained exchangers in detail in my research paper regarding J<a href="https://medium.com/thedeephub/how-12-year-olds-hack-thousands-of-accounts-a-day-da13b96f5df1" data-href="https://medium.com/thedeephub/how-12-year-olds-hack-thousands-of-accounts-a-day-da13b96f5df1" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">uvenile Fraudsters</a>.</p><h3 name="eed5" id="eed5" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Remediation</h3><figure name="674b" id="674b" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*UttacGl5KRT_KXEF.jpg" data-width="894" data-height="284" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*UttacGl5KRT_KXEF.jpg"></figure><p name="2004" id="2004" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">There needs to be trust in the government, currency, and US economy. This can be done by educating the youth about how the economy works, but without making it a boring or difficult class-it needs to be something fun and useful. Highschools require a Macroeconomics class to be taken before graduation, and although it is useful and teaches quite a lot it does not induce faith or trust in the US currency at all. The buzzwords “inflation” and “housing crisis” leaves our children desperate and unable to take the honest route. For them there’s no point in working so hard for a college degree and drowning in debt when they can just take the shortcut. It’s crucial we educate our youth and protect them from making these mistakes.</p><p name="618c" id="618c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Moreover, the mainstream shows and movies commonly found on Netflix, Youtube, Hulu, and other platforms glorify crimes and drug trafficking which only further influences our children. The solution: don’t shield them from reality-but educate them and lead by example. Yes, it <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">IS </strong>easy money, it <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">IS</strong>, easier than a college degree, but it’s <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">NOT</strong> a fulfilling life, and it’s <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">NOT</strong> something sustainable or a pillar you can build a career or family on.</p></div></div></section>

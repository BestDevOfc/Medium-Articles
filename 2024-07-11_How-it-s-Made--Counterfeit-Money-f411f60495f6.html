We begin by explaining all of the security features of a real US bill, and then how it’s replicated by counterfeiters. Technical methods are used in counterfeiting, from specialized paper to evading DRM systems. However, it’s important to remember the legal repurcussions from attempting any of this and how this merely serves as a method of raising awareness and protecting YOU from falling victim to counterfeit bills. Let’s dive right in!</p><figure name="9073" id="9073" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*r0EGfwAlH7g_2dOe.jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="1020" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*r0EGfwAlH7g_2dOe.jpg"></figure><p name="75d2" id="75d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Counterfeit bills are harmful to the economy and in third-world countries such as Pakistan it’s a huge issue. In fact, Pakistan’s been battling counterfeit bills and credit card fraud for decades and have gone as far as demonetizing (invalidating a denomination) and releasing new bills with harder-to-fake protections. Counterfeit bills have cost the US economy billions every year-and it’s rising.</p><p name="2bed" id="2bed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Before we dive into how crooks make their own counterfeit bills, it’s important to understand all the safeguards and protections these bills have in place. Moreover, it’s important to note that attempting to make a counterfeit bill in the US is not only unethical but is a grave felony that can land you up to 20 years in prison and huge trouble with the Secret Service (not worth it). Well, let’s get into it!</p><h3 name="72cb" id="72cb" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Chapter 1: Getting the Right Paper</h3><p name="0818" id="0818" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Have you ever noticed how even when your cash gets wet or forgotten in your pockets and thrown into the washer AND dryer it comes out perfectly fine? This is done intentionally, the US dollar is not printed on typical printing paper, and the “paper” is actually more of a cloth. The dollar is made up of 75% linen and 25% cotton in order to give it more durability.</p><figure name="e601" id="e601" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*3hSw1PFe2jOeqyXU2ldr2g.png" data-width="1028" data-height="938" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3hSw1PFe2jOeqyXU2ldr2g.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">You see the color? It’s a dark yellowish color and the texture is nothing like your typical white printer paper.</figcaption></figure><p name="31f1" id="31f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Therefore, a lot of counterfeiters will purchase this type of paper in bulk or will set up shell companies and purchase similar-feeling paper or by tricking companies into producing the perfect material needed. This was done by Frank Bourassa where he tricked a German paper company into producing the perfect paper using the right amount of cotton and linen mixture.</p><h4 name="e653" id="e653" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Another Interesting Approach</h4><p name="bbc9" id="bbc9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Sometimes people will take a genuine $1 or $5 bill, bleach the ink off of it, and then print a higher denomination bill on top of that such as a $20 or $100 bill and pass that off as a genuine. This process is referred to as “washing”. This reduces the complexity of counterfeiting a bill because the texture, color, and feel are almost perfect and only the security strip and watermarks won’t match (will be discussed in chapters 4 and 9).</p><figure name="e5ee" id="e5ee" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*dbFsJIIwM66J4YDI" data-width="2600" data-height="1950" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*dbFsJIIwM66J4YDI"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Holding it up to the light makes it obious it’s been printed over, some people will go as far as using powerful chemicals to remove all prints.</figcaption></figure><h4 name="2c4c" id="2c4c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">Small Detail a lot of People Miss</h4><p name="5149" id="5149" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">If you look very closely at a US bill using only the naked eye all over the bill there are these tiny blue and red strands scattered. They almost look like tiny threads of lint that got stuck into the bill from clothing. This is a side effect of the 75% linen and 25% cotton mixture that causes this feature. When I get cash this is one of the things I look for quickly amongst the security strip, texture, and water marks.</p><figure name="1661" id="1661" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*JNHaOHOVRj16okeI9tL1Fw.png" data-width="2266" data-height="1126" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*JNHaOHOVRj16okeI9tL1Fw.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Harder to capture with a camera, but with the naked eye it’s quite easy to spot these strands.</figcaption></figure><h3 name="a8f9" id="a8f9" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Chapter 2: Printing</h3><figure name="89fa" id="89fa" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*ijgj0oPVmAUGFvLP" data-width="1024" data-height="622" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ijgj0oPVmAUGFvLP"></figure><p name="fbb9" id="fbb9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">If you look closely at a dollar bill you’ll notice a few serial numbers that are unique for every bill. In order to counterfeit these can be simple if being done on a small-scale, simply change the number to another. Moreover, there is a format and algorithm used to generate these numbers, for example, they’re not just random numbers, but have prefixes that mean something. After taking care of this, the hard part comes-the ink, printer, and color to use. A lot of counterfeiters have turned to HP Inkjet printers due to how accurately they can print colors.</p><figure name="2a10" id="2a10" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*hT2-6yJ3vrdPueyu.png" data-width="1120" data-height="630" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*hT2-6yJ3vrdPueyu.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Commercial HP Laser Printer</figcaption></figure><p name="8ed3" id="8ed3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Now grab a clean bill, scan it, and print-right? Not so fast, you may be able to scan the bill without any problems, but before you can even print a bill there are security protections in place already. Many printers have special DRMS, these are small chips that can detect if you’re trying to print a counterfeit bill and will immediately cease, print it incorrectly, or even brick your printer! The way these work is by detecting the EURion constellation on your bill. These are hidden throughout the bills. More professional counterfeiters will use <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">laser printers </strong>as they inject the ink directly into the paper using lasers and this leads to a more accurate finish. The inkjet printers use liquid ink which can lead to inconsistencies, but the laser printers use dry powder which adheres to the paper better and does not have any blurs or “spots”. Lastly, laser printers typically aren’t equipped with the DRMs that are responsible for detecting the EURion constellation.</p><figure name="c72b" id="c72b" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*91TolfhS8xwTLyYJ.jpg" data-width="400" data-height="400" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*91TolfhS8xwTLyYJ.jpg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">These will be in different spots depending on the bill.</figcaption></figure><p name="28a7" id="28a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">You may think it’s easy to bypass this, just edit it out-right? Nope, many photo editing softwares, such as Adobe photoshop can also detect these patterns and may not even load your scanned bill into their software. To bypass this, many crooks use software specifically designed for counterfeiting or they’ll download cracked, pirated, or modified software using qBittorrent and online forums to get the job done.</p><figure name="14d9" id="14d9" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*2YEYCDyQVaAd4tNK" data-width="446" data-height="242" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*2YEYCDyQVaAd4tNK"></figure><p name="8138" id="8138" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Many can be found on Telegram that are riddled with Malware so many crooks will load them into a VirtualMachine using VirtualBox. Once the scanned bill is loaded into the software it’s possible to print the image to the printer via the software completely bypassing the detections. In some cases the EURion constellation needs to be edited or slightly modified in order to print-it all depends on the printer being used.</p><h4 name="7b69" id="7b69" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Perfecting the Texture</h4><p name="abe6" id="abe6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Many cashiers handle thousands of bills a week and can tell if a bill is fake or genuine just by its touch. This is because of the unique texture genuine US bills have. It’s a kind of smooth, paper-like, flexible feel. Faking this is quite easy, many counterfeiters will soak their freshly-printed bills in a bucket of vinegar and bleach for 10–15 minutes, and then leave them to air-dry.</p><figure name="8f62" id="8f62" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*LW-VE9ynosy0UNEyuouSzA.png" data-width="3012" data-height="1300" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LW-VE9ynosy0UNEyuouSzA.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Youtube channel: Vice. A common capital for US counterfeit bills is Peru. These are often smuggled into the US in books, hidden in toys, and food cans.</figcaption></figure><p name="3283" id="3283" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Many professional counterfeiters will have their own custom printing bills assembled, custom ink, paper, and a different system to print and stamp the serial number altogether, but this is more focused on individual, small-scaled counterfeiters as these crooks collectively can damage the US economy more. It’s easy to bust a single operation, but what about millions of small-scale operations-not so easy.</p><h4 name="8829" id="8829" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Gluing the two sides</h4><figure name="a3a4" id="a3a4" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h4"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*VA2uHfkiglC4T7VLpkCYYQ.png" data-width="1866" data-height="1068" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*VA2uHfkiglC4T7VLpkCYYQ.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">After thinning out the excess thickness the glue is applied and then ironed and let to dry.</figcaption></figure><p name="60f5" id="60f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">After the texture is perfected the bills are slightly wet, and from here people will use a soft, fluffy sponge to slightly thin out the paper in order to prevent a thick finish. After the thinning process elmer’s glue is applied and after a few minutes of drying it is ironed to give it a nice finish and flattened. This can easily be replicated when printing bills in bulk-that’s what makes it so scary and effective.</p><p name="b810" id="b810" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Read part 2 here: </strong><a href="https://medium.com/@alimuhammadsecured/making-counterfeit-us-bills-part-2-230bb77371e1" data-href="https://medium.com/@alimuhammadsecured/making-counterfeit-us-bills-part-2-230bb77371e1" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Click Me!</strong></a></p></div></div></section>
